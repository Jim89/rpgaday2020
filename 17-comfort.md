## Comfort

Playing RPGs, at the moment, give me a great sense of comfort. 

This is perhaps because these are inherently uncomfortable times, what with the
global pandemic, the politics of both my current and home countries, and my own
difficulties transitioning from one city to another. Playing (online) with a group that I had played with when I was still in Atlanta brought me a great sense of comfort recently. 

The sense of familiarty and community that game brought to my evening was
extremely welcome. It had been something of a long week at work after a series
of long weeks and longer months as I have (to some extent) struggled slightly to
adapt to my new home. It's not all doom and gloom, and there are many things
about my new location that I enjoy, but it hasn't been an easy transition, and I
have missed the sense of comfort that I had found at "home" in Atlanta. I'm, to
put it simply, a little homesick.

The rememedy, in my experience of being homesick previously, is to try and
capture some of those feelings of home, some of those feelings of _comfort_ that
one experiences when one is at home. RPGs have helped me to experience those
feelings recently. I recognise the need to find those feelings
independetly/separately, of course, but I will for now take them where I can get
them and I'm glad that I have games, and players of games, in my life to help me
find them here and there.
