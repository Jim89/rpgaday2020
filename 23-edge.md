## Edge

I can't really write much else related to "edge" than something about "Edge of
the Empire".

This was the first game (outside of DnD as a kid) that I'd read about before
playing and thought "I _really_ want to play that." Partly because I love Star
Wars, and partly because I loved the idea of playing a TTRPG, it was Edge of the
Empire and (if I'm  remembering correctly), Shut Up and Sit Down's brief
playthrough of a few games of it that really drew me to the hobby.

When I played it, I found that the game itself is also (in my opinion) great. I
may not have much to compare it to, but the Narrative Dice (whilst sometimes a
little fiddly and slightly prone to dice-pool bloat at higher PC experience
levels) showed me the storytelling capabilities of RPGs. They gave me a tool
express myself as a player much more than the (mostly) binary outcomes of
D20/DnD, and a tool to feel comfortable as a GM (really, they're great, you can
really let the dice do a lot of the talking for you).

Sure, it was technically DnD that I played first. But it was a game of Edge of
the Empire that really got me to fall in love with the hobby. It was a game of
Edge of the Empire that I met my Atlana gaming group, through which I met people
who have become important friends in my life. It was an online game of Edge of
the Empire that brought me [comfort](17-comfort.md) when I moved cities, that
gave me that sense of normalcy I was missing moving to a strange new place.

It's not a perfect game (FFG themselves saw that and smoothed a lot of rough
edges in Genesys, their setting-agnostic follow-up), but it will always hold a
special place in my heart.
