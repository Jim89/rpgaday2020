## Tower

A think a tower could be an interesting "anti-dungeon" adventure idea. 

Rather than develing into the depts of a dungeon, the player characters instead
scale a vast tower. Maybe something that's impossibly (or at least improbably)
high, maybe with atmospheric shifts as the tower climbs up and up into the sky.

The thing the player characters want is at the top of the tower (rather than the
bottom of a dungeon). As they climb, they face challenges along the way (much
like the traditional dungeon). These challenges could be the traditional combat,
social, environmental set pieces one would find in a dungeon. Or perhaps the
characters need to go _outside_ the tower, and scale the _exterior_ rather than
the interior.

When they reach the top and have their showdown, perhaps the lower levels are
suddenly inaccessible, and they need to devise a plan to escape that involves,
again, going outside. They probably can't just jump (or can they?), but maybe
they can climb, or traverse to a vehicle a friendly NPC (or smart player) has
set up for them. Maybe the tower extends so high that they end up in space, or
at least in a completely different environment that they now need to navigate
through (like the realm of the gods in a mythology setting).

Where the dungeon is dark and dank and oppressive, the tower is light and airy
and, ok it's still pretty oppressive the way I described it. But it turns the
dungeon trope on its head a bit, gives players some alternatives to explore, and
has some potentially interesting subsequent/follow on encounters rather than a
walk/fight your way back out of the dungeon. Maybe I'll give this a whirl when I
get back to running games.
