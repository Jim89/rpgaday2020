## Dramatic

I hope some of my earlier posts have not been too (emotionally) dramatic.

As a fairly stereotypical Englishman when it comes to expressing or showing
emotions, I have looked back on some of my earlier posts and seen what, to me,
feels like an uncharacteristic display of emotion in some of my writing. I worry
slightly that this may be too over-the-top, too personal for the spirit of
#rpgaday, too dramatic.

But, I suppose that there's not much I can do about that. The posts felt
(roughtly) right at the time, and a little bit of drama never seemed to hurt
playing an RPG, so maybe it won't hurt me to express some either.
