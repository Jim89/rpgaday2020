## Vision

Before I started playing RPGs, I think I had a vision of what they'd be like. I
imagined I'd be playing something akin to the cRPGs I'd grown up with, only with
more freedom and flexiblity to push the boundaries of the game. I was half
right. 

In my experience, the boundaries of the game _are_ pushed and expanded on one
side (freedom to go explore, freedom to _create_, even as player), but they
shrink and collapse on others (restrictions due to time and coordination with
the other players). My vision of what a TTRPG was needed some adjustments. Not
to say that TTRPGs felt restrictive or closed, just that I had been looking at
the boundaries expand in one direction, and not directed my vision to the other
realities of gaming with a group, rather than alone.

There were also elements that I hadn't seen. The ability of a game to help
[build a community](01-beginning.md), or to help deal with periods of
[change](02-change.md) in one's life were things I'd read others gush about for
some computer games, but that I'd never really experienced myself. Games were a
form of escapism for me as a teenager, sure, but I don't think I'd say I'd ever
seen them as something helpful and supportive (dare one say _therapeutic_) more
broadly than that. 

Now, I would, and I'm glad I've come to see this side of games, and seen how
play can not only be a fun diversion from everyday tedium, but also a more
enriching and fulfilling part of my life.
