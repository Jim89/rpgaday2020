## Couple

I wouldn't play RPGs if I wasn't part of a couple. 

This isn't completely true, my fiance is not the sole reason that I play them. But as I [mentioned](01-beginning.md), were it not for following them to America, I wouldn't have met the folks I game with now and my RPG journey may never have started (or, at least, it may have started much more slowly).

So, in part, I have my relationship to thank for starting me down the RPG path. I certainly have it to thank for keeping me on the path. It was my partner who encouraged me into gaming when I first moved, to keep going to meet ups and to find other folks to play with. It's my parter who supports my hobby (even if they don't share it), who encourages me to play, to create, and to build friendships with the people that I play with. I love my partner very much, and part of the reason is because of how they accept my hobbies and allow me to be "more me", more of the time. 

I may play, or may have ended up playing RPGs without my partner. As I've written, I'd always been interested in them. And whilst it may have taken me longer, there's nothing to say that I _wouldn't_ have ended up playing them anyway. But that's not what happened, I _did_ move, I _did_ start playing, I _do_ continue to play, I am continually encouraged and supported to be myself, and maintain an interest in the things that I find interested (and which, to some, may make me interesting). And the couple that I'm one half of is part of the reason for that, and I'm grateful for it everyday.
