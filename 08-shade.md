## Shade

I think there are shades of RPGs in many games I've enjoyed growing up/enjoy now. The big one for me is a board game (and, coincidentally a board game that's quite literally "the big one" in the board gaming community): [Twilight Imperium](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition/).

It's branded as strategy game; a grand space opera of aliens competing for the rulership of the galaxy. But (as I've discussed with friends before), for me it's really an RPG. It was and is the RPG I played before I played RPGs. 

Sure, at the heart of the game every faction/species is performing the same actions, trying to eke out the same advantages, pull off the same tactical maneuvers, and is trying to fulfil the same objectives (TI is, unlike any "true" RPG I've played, a highly competetive game). But for me it was always so much more than that. Was I going to be the Emirates of Hacan, the famous [space lions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUpFlkTvQgg&list=LLXlgagVOrc6YBbIEbkAHHcg&index=3541) from the cover art: shrewed negotiators and rutheless traders; or perhaps the "peace turtles"; or the warlike Sol (humans, the bad guys as always); or the sneaky Yssaril tribes, scheming through subterfuge and misdirection. 

The _story_ of the game always meant so much more to me than the strategic cut-and-thrust of play. _Who_ I was and how they interacted with the world guided my play, guided how _I_ interacted with the other players. This didn't always mean that I had _successful_ games of TI (in the strict, accumulation of victory-points sense), but I was _playing a role_, I was inhabiting a galaxy (far, far away, if not a long time ago) and finding a narrative through my actions and those of the other players at the table. 

It was those shades of rollplay that hooked me in the first place, and that keep me coming back, that make TI the greatest game I have ever played (even if it does take literally all day).
