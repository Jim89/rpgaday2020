## Beginning

"Beginning" reminds me of the time I began playing table top role playing games in 2018. 

I had recently moved from London (UK) to Atlanta (USA) which, as you might imagine, had not been an insubstantial change in my life. My partner (whom I met in London) was then at medical school in New Orleans. I had moved to be closer to them, and Atlanta was as close as I could get. This meant that I was alone in a new country on the surface similar to my own but underneath (as I was discovering), very different. 

I'd always had an interest in playing a table top RPG, having got my start playing computer-based "classic" RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment and Fallout, and later any RPG I could sink my teeth in to (The Elder Scrolls and Witcher series both featured prominently). But I'd never found a group to play on the tabletop with. 

So, being alone in a new place, with a large amount of free time on my hands (the majority of my belongings would take 6-months to cross the Atlantic and make their way to me), I sought out games. A colleague (now friend) introduced me to a gaming group he was part of, I started going to some weekly DnD events at a local pub, and I scoured Meetup.com for local RPG groups, finding and joining a game of Fantasy Flight's Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. 

These events were not only the "beginning" of my TTRPG experiences, but also a major part of the beginning of my life in the US. Through beginning to play TTRPGs I began to make friends, I began to find a sense of community in a new and very different place to what I had grown up with. After being a player for a while, I decided to try my hand at being the GM, and set up a home game with a mixture of friends from work and the gaming group I was now a member of. We still play together now. 

"Beginning" to play roleplaying games, therefore, means a lot to me. It represents not only the start of a hobby, but of friendships, of communities, of a whole new chapter in my life. "Beginning" these things was and is incredibly important to me, and I'm so grateful that I had, and happy that I took, the opportunity to do so.
