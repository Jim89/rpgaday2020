## Rare

Some of my favourite sort of moments when playing RPGs are also the rarest. 

Those moments when one player/character makes a clever quip, that's quickly
followed up by a complimentary quip from another. Or when a series of actions
and events leads to a perfect storm of some sort of narrative interest (whether
that's humour, intrigue, fear, tension, or something else). When all the dominos
line up perfectly and tumble down together in a glorious chain of fun.

These moments are what keep me coming back. Like [drop bears](06-forest.md), or
the hilarity of my game of [The Ward](09-light.md), or my character in
[Alex's](05-tribute.md) game and the endless back and forth over their title
("Captain Dr." or "Dr. Captain", we never resolved it). Those small moments that
are not common, but that remind me every now and then of why I play, and why I
love to play.

They may be rare, but they're the reason I love this hobby, and the reason I
want to keep it in my life.
