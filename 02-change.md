## Change

"Change" reminds me of how much my life has changed since I started playing RPGs, and how they continue to be involved in the change in my life. 

As I mentioned [yesterday](01-beginning.md), I first started playing RPGs shortly after moving from the UK to the USA, a major change in my life. Across the first couple of years in the USA (I've been here since Jan 2020), my life continued to change. I settled in, I found friends, I became part of a community. Then, my life changed again. 

My partner graduated from medical school in May 2020, becoming a surgeon. In New York City. So we moved; they from New Orleans, me from Atlanta. In June of 2020. In the middle of a global pandemic, we moved across a continent, to one of the country's (world's?) hardest-hit cities. Suffice to say, things were a little different to what I'd gotten used to. I was apprehensive about the change, scared to leave the stability I had established for myself in Atlana and scared to live in a city that I freely admit was not my first choice. 

But RPGs, and the friends I'd made through them, were there to help me through. An online game I'd been part of (unsurprisingly) carried on, providing some much needed continuity  and stability when so much else in my life was in flux. I was sad to leave my friends in Atlanta, but the friendships haven't ended (although of course they have changed). We still talk, we still play; we're between RPG campaigns, but there are plans afoot for us to start up something more regular and continue with the semi regular play we'd established for ourselves. 

So the "change" prompt is, for now, about my ability to deal with it, and about how RPGs, and the people I have met through playing them, have helped me deal with it.
