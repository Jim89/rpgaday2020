## Want

There's a lot I want from RPGs. In short, I want _more_.

I want to play Fate. I want to play more Star Wars. I want to explore new
settings in Genesys. I want to keep playing small, [lightweight](09-light.md)
games with humourous themes and dramatic possiblities. I want to immerse myself
in a world, experience the strange and the weird stories I've seen and read and
heard about in podcasts, YouTube videos, and blog posts.

I also want my games to be personal. I want to (continue) to use them as a way
to build and strengthen my personal relationships. I want to use them to keep in
touch with friends I'm now geographically distant from. I want to find new
people to play with, to make new friends and tell new stories with them, whilst
not forgetting the friends I play with now.

I want drama and intrigue and horror and humour and depth and meaning and fun
and silliness and, sometimes, a break from reality. 

I want too much. 

But the fact that there are still things I want from this hobby keep me excited
and envigorated and eager to keep playing.
