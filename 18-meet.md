## Meet

I've already used earlier posts to talk about how RPGs [helped](01-beginning.md)
me to meet other people, so I'm a little stumped by this prompt. 

Maybe (and taking this series to a new level of extreme navel-gazing) I could
say that RPGs have helped me to meet myself a bit. Yeah, ok, I need to get over
myself. But let me roll with it for a bit.

I think RPGs have shown me how much I value contact with other people, how much
I value friendship, and how much I value a sense (however vague) of community or
belonging. These are probably aspects of myself that I hadn't really considered
when I was still in the UK, and it's been nice to see that side of myself. Of
course RPGs can't claim all the credit, there are other things at play here, but
RPGs have certainly helped.

One area where I think RPGs have let me meet a different side of myself, though,
is creativity. I'd never really considered myself to be a creature person
(which, on reflection, is a bit nonsensical as I've been playing jazz drums for
the last 15 years...). But RPGs, specifically _running_ RPGs, have shown me that
I do have a creative side. That side is something I want to keep working on
improving, strengthening my storytelling capabilities and taking them to new
places. I [want](10-want.md) to keep pushing myself to tell new stories, with
new people, in new settings, with new themes. Creativity is a side of myself
that I'm glad I got to meet, and I hope I can continue to see more of it in
future. 

Ok, that's enough navel gazing (no promises for the rest of the series, though!).
