## Rest

A short one today (I'm taking a rest). 

Resting/downtime in RPGs is (marginally) interesting to me. On the one side, a
requirement for a rest (in the DnD) sense feels a bit arbitrary.

"I want to cast fireball!"

"I'm sorry, but you can't, you did that today already, you'll need to rest
before you can do it again."

"..."

That just feels like a wholly unsatisfying situation to me. _Why_ does my
character need to rest. Yeah I get that "them's the rules", but that just feels
so blunt and _boring_. Now this is a fairly specific complaint, and other
systems handle this differently, but narratively forgetting how to cast a spell
until you looked at your spellbook and had a nap again always felt dull.

But a rest, or a period of downtime could also be interesting or fun. Having
players describe what their characters do during downtime can lead to
interesting hooks you might not think of otherwise (e.g. "I go and visit ABC"
means that ABC can now be brought into play, if you want). You can also use
downtime to handwave narratively dull shopping trips, or other mundane
activities. The story keeps moving, but the _game_ doesn't need to stop for
players to act out buying some new stimpacs (unless they really want to). Or,
you can use the rest for some fun narrative moments; the GM for the Star Wars
game I'm currently playing in will occasionally say "tell me a problem that
comes up during your downtime, and how the group resolves it." These moments
give us, the players, a great moment to role play and indulge in some
pure-narrative silliness.

Much better than having a nap so you can remember that spell again...
