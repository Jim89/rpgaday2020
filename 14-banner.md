## Banner

In a way, I wish DnD wasn't the banner game for this hobby.

I don't have a _major_ problem with DnD, but I do think there are better games.
I've seen the overwhelmed look in the eyes of players (mostly at local DnD
meetups) who join their first game; seen the vague sense of confusion with the
dice, the modifiers, the rollling to hit then rolling for damage, with the
terminology and, sometimes, with the setting. (Ok you can use the DnD rules in
any setting, really, but the name of the game suggests a fairly specific one).

I don't know if I have a different game I'd suggest instead, mainly due to lack
of experience on my part. But something that waves the RPG banner that doesn't
require, or doesn't _feel like it requires_ a set on institutional knowledge or
history to really get _into_ would be nice. My sense is that lots of players
(based purely on, again, local DnD meetups) are looking for that narrative,
story-driven experience they've seen or read about online, and I don't think DnD
is a great system for experiencing that.

I [want](10-want.md) to raise the banner high. But I want that banner to be more
than DnD. I want that banner to be welcoming and easy to understand and
streamlined and straightforward and _fun_. DnD _can_ be those things, it's just
that, a lot of the time, it isn't (in my experience). I want more and more
people to see that banner. I want people to flock to it, to join the party
happening around the flag pole. I want to see that banner fluttering in the
breeze, welcoming new and old players alike to this wonderful hobby.
