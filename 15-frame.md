## Frame

I'd like to get a picture of the characters from my home RPG game framed.

I'd like to commission it first, of course. But there was a connection to those
characters that I'd like to hold on to. I think, really, the connection is of
course to the _players_, rather than the characters. But I'm probably unlikely
to get a group picture of all the players in that game (mainly because of
logistics).

In that sense, the characters act as proxies for their players in the emotional
bonds I've formed with/to them. Those players, as I have mentioned
[once](01-beginning.md) or [twice](05-tribute.md), became very important to me
as my life was changing during the course of our play. And many of the shared
memories I have with those players are of play, and most of those memories are
of their characters doing something foolish or heroic or funny or dangerous or
just _cool_ and _memorable_.

So to frame their characters would be to frame the players, to frame the large,
positive impact they've had on me and on my life and, I hope, that they may
continue to have on my life in the future.
