## Investigate

I like the idea of investigations in RPGs but, as a GM, they seem scary and
intimidating. 

This is probably because my GM style is what might euphemistically be called
"prep-lite", ~~and coming up with an investigation on the fly is well beyond my
capabilities.~~ and coming up with a _coherent, consistent, logical_
investigation on the fly is well beyond my capabilities. But, if I could
motivate myself to do some more prep, I feel like an investigation-style game
would be one I might enjoy running.

Maybe because I don't particularly enjoy combat as the primary obstacle in an
RPG, although I'm not opposed to its inclusion in a game. An investigation _can_
contain combat, but one doesn't imagine solving an investigation as much through
punching as through deduction, speaking to people, casing the scene, or through
flashes of genius and "ah-ha!" moments.

Those aspects of a story seem interesting to me. They probably take the right GM
and the right group of players to pull off well, although that might just be my
GM-inexperience talking. But with a good group of players I think an
investigation is fertile ground for the kinds of scenes and encounters that I
really "dig" when I'm playing an RPG.

Throw in a few one liners or quick quips as the evidence is laid bare, and I'm
sold.
